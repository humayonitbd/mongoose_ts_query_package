## Documentation
## Overview

The QueryBuilder class is designed to streamline and enhance querying operations. It provides methods to search, filter, sort, paginate, and select specific fields from a query. Each method is designed to be intuitive and efficient, allowing for flexible and powerful query construction.

## Methods
search(searchableFields: string[])

* Description: Adds a search condition to the query.
* Functionality: Matches any of the specified fields using a case-insensitive regex.
* Parameters:
 searchableFields (string[]): An array of field names to be searched.

## filter()
* Description: Filters the query based on the provided query parameters.
* Functionality: Excludes specific fields used for other operations such as search, sort, limit, page, and fields.
* Parameters: None. The method operates based on the query parameters provided externally.

## sort()
* Description: Sorts the query based on the provided sort parameters.
* Functionality: If no sort parameter is specified, it defaults to sorting by -createdAt. for descending sorting use "-" before the sorting field exp:-name,-ratings.
* Parameters: None. The method uses the sort parameters provided externally.

## paginate()

## Usage
To use the QueryBuilder class, instantiate it and utilize its methods to build your query. Each method can be chained to create a comprehensive query operation.

const query = req.query;
const queryBuilder = new QueryBuilder(Student.find(), query);
queryBuilder
  .search(["name", "description"])
  .filter()
  .sort()
  .paginate()
  .fields();

  ## exmaple

import QueryBuilder from "mongoose_ts_query_builder";
import { Student } from "./student.model";

const studentSearchableFields = ["name", "email", "studentId"];

const getAllStudentService = async (query: Record<string, unknown>) => {
  const student = Student.find().populate("admissionSemester");

  const studentQuery = new QueryBuilder(student, query)
    .search(studentSearchableFields)
    .filter()
    .sort()
    .paginate()
    .fields();

  const result = await studentQuery.modelQuery;
  return result;
};
